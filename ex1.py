# what did I learn today?
# Print
# to give instructions to Computer through Atom (text editor) to print some text

# Comment
# is a new word for me as the computer only understands the computer language.
# Strictly to understand that it does not show any output at Powershell or Github
# Comment is not read by computer

# Save
# essential to save the command at text editor to see the output at Powershell

# push
# Once the file is save it is require to push the file to show it at Github

# Powershell
# It is where you find the documents and files. Also see the output while given instructions

# command
# Computer language to run the program


print (" Hello World!")
print ("Hello Again")
print ("I like typing this.")
print ("This is fun.")
print ('Yay! Printing.')
print ("I'd much rather you 'not'")
print ('I "said" do not touch this.')

# print("i am having tea")
